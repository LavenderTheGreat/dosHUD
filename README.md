# dosHUD

### A hud for TF2 attempting to emulate that of old DOS games.

dosHUD is that legendary hud that people have seemingly asked for [time (24 days ago, 25 upvotes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/hgxdvz/looking_for_a_tf2_hud_that_looks_similar_to_this/) and [time (27 days ago, 3.7k upvotes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/hgt9e6/is_there_a_hud_that_looks_similar_to_this/) and [time (2 years ago)](https://gamebanana.com/requests/10021) (you may see here that the request is finished, it actually never did get finished: [here](https://gamebanana.com/wips/48665)) again and for some odd reason nobody ever actually made, or rather finished.

This started to really peeve me off so here I am with a TF2 hud based on the image from 27 days ago... 

***dosHUD is the HUD you always wanted but never got.***

## Features

- An absolutely massive bottom bar done in perfect ratio to the original DooM

- Support for 3D models, zoomed in on the face to evoke that classic DooM vibe

- Support for every single item that exists in the game, all fit snugly onto the HUD

- Support for 4:3 as well as any resolution wider than 4:3 (16:9, 21:9)

- Team coloured themes, so you aren't stuck weirdly with blu on red and vice versa

- Absolutely zero intuitive-ness, much like the original DooM

- Cleanly overlaid over the original HUD files, anything not touched by dosHUD is left in it's default state.

## FAQ

- **Does this work with the latest version?** Probably. TF2 basically never updates now.

- **Why 'dosHUD', why not 'doomHUD'?** If you look a bit into it, you'll realise that a lot of DOS games use this HUD and even Quake 3, which wasn't on DOS, uses a derivative of this HUD style. Games that used HUD like this include:

    - Wolfenstein 3D

    - DooM

    - DooM 2

    - Quake

    - Quake 2

    - Quake 3

    - Hexen

    - Chex Quest
    
    - Duke Nukem

- **Will this ever expand into the main menu?** This is something I'd love to do but I feel the novelty might not be there on some of it, plus the menu wouldn't play ball half the time due to the new meet your match things.

- **The HUD model for [class with certain weapon] isn't centered!** Centering it as it is was already a pain, class poses vary massively.

- **I've found a bug with something you should be supporting, where can I report it?** Under Github issues is the best place to report them, *reports are accepted through Twitter and Discord though if you know me on those platforms,* ***however all reports given to me through there will be put onto Github issues publicly.***
